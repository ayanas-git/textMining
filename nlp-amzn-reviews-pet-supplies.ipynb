    "**Data**: Pet Supplies Reviews from [Amazon product data](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/)\\\n",
    "**Provider**: Julian McAuley, USCD\\\n",
    "**Description**: This dataset contains product reviews and metadata from Amazon, including 142.8 million reviews spanning May 1996 - July 2014.\\\n",
    "This dataset includes reviews (ratings, text, helpfulness votes), product metadata (descriptions, category information, price, brand, and image features), and links (also viewed/also bought graphs).\\\n",
    "**5-core**: Subset of the data in which all users and items have at least 5 reviews.\\\n",
    "**Format**: one-review-per-lline in (loose) json.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definitions**: \n",
    "> **reviewerID** - ID of the reviewer, e.g. A2SUAM1J3GNN3B \\\n",
    "> **asin** - ID of the product, e.g. 0000013714 \\\n",
    "> **reviewerName** - name of the reviewer \\\n",
    "> **helpful** - helpfulness rating of the review, e.g. 2/3 \\\n",
    "> **reviewText** - text of the review \\\n",
    "> **overall** - rating of the product \\\n",
    "> **summary** - summary of the review \\\n",
    "> **unixReviewTime** - time of the review (unix time) \\\n",
    "> **reviewTime** - time of the review (raw) \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**: Selected a *“Small” subset for experimentation*, which uses `K-cores`. These data have been reduced to extract the k-core, such that each of the remaining users and items have k reviews each. (McAuley) The concept of a k-core was introduced to study the clustering structure of social networks and to describe the evolution of random graphs."
